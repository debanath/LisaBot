# <center> Lisa Bot </center>

It was my first time making a discord bot so yeah this doesnt have a whole lot of features. For now it only responds to certain messages and you can use the bot as some sort of mod mail or something. If someone DM the bot something it will be sent to a channel of your choice and you can also see who sent the message, so that you can reply to the people who's queries are relavant without constantly getting dms from everyone in the server
